# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please reach out directly to us when reporting a security vulnerability via `hello@eclean.gg`.

We make every effort to respond as soon as possible, although it may take a day or two for us to sync internally and determine the severity of the report and its impact.

Please, _do not_ use a public facing channel or GitHub issues to report sensitive security issues.

As part of our process, we will create a security advisory for the affected versions and disclose it publicly, usually one to two weeks after a releasing a build that addresses it.
